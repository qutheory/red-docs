We are sad to announce that Vapor Red will be shutting down on February 29th. After Vapor Red shuts down, your servers will continue to run and be accessible via your service provider's dashboard. Please note you will continue to be billed by your service provider normally. 

For more information on the shutdown, including guides for migrating to other platforms, please visit our docs. 

Going forward, the Vapor core team will be concentrating its efforts on the framework and all of its open source packages. This includes new, free guides for deploying to platforms like Amazon Web Services, Digital Ocean, and Heroku. 

We greatly appreciate your support of Vapor thus far and we look forward to continuing to grow the framework with you.
